# [Youtube and RSS discord bot](https://github.com/ScriptSathi/discord_rss)


***UNDER MAINTAINANCE FOR BIG REFORGE, THE DOC BELLOW IS NOT UP TO DATE***

## Introduction 

This bot is used to follow a RSS feed or a youtube channel and post it over discord channels
<br/>
This is part of a full featured discord bot, the [Deep Search Gatherer bot](https://github.com/ScriptSathi/Deep_Search_Gatherer). It can be run on it's own or with the [Scrape2RSS project](https://github.com/ScriptSathi/scrape2RSS) for tracking any websites that don't have rss feed and you wish to follow.

## Features 

- Follow an RSS feed and post latests news
- Follow a Youtube channel and post latests videos

## Disclaimer

If you are unfamiliar with Docker, check out the [Introduction to Docker](https://training.docker.com/introduction-to-docker) webinar, or consult your favorite search engine.

## Build the image

Simply run the following command from this project source directory to build your new image
```
docker build -t rssbot .
```
## Usage

The configuration file is compatible with either `json` and `yaml` (or `yml`) format.
To understand how this project must be run, we will take the example with a valid yaml configuration file
The file don't need to be called `config.yaml` but need to be placed in `/config` folder. The file must be in a valid **JSON format**
```
docker run -d -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/config/config.yaml --name=rssbot rssbot
```
You should then see your bot online on discord 

**Note:** If you've previously run a container with the same name, this command will fail. In that instance, you can use:
```
docker rm rssbot
```
